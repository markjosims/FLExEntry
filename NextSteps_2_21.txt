* All matches in the FLEx data have been removed or have notes indicating any issues w/ them in merge_matches.csv OR in new_matches.csv
* Still need to "condense" variants
	- morphological variants (e.g. "taah pl. of t'aah") should all be in one str in Bibliographic Field
	- first step to do this is to print out a set of all unique variant types so I can know what I'm dealing w/
* Also question of linking roots to entries that are clearly PFX + root
	- use list of prefixes and match algorithm, tweak distance parameter to only accept e.g. >=0.95 (no sense overloading
	ourselves w/ false positives)
* Remove variant fields that reference records that have been deleted.
* Enforce consistent formatting in bibliography column
	- also, remove bibliography key from notes column wherever present
* Enforce consistent formatting in PoS field
* Enforce consistent usage of apostrophes
* Prepend asterisk to hypothetical records
* Re-match these_vars and other_sources to right guid's cuz they somehow got shuffled #FIXED#
* Resolve all instances of %OR% in FlexiconMERGE.csv
* Remove number before guid when not needed
