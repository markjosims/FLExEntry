# Texts

- it looks like sth abt how new entries are generated in text analysis is REALLY prone to making
a bunch of duplicates
- for Yuca, consider making a separate lexicon solely for ad-hoc entries used in text glossing,
w/ streamlined way to import into main lexicon

# Fieldwork Data

- a lot of words previously only attested in other sources (mainly SIL, also Martins & Barbosa)
are now attested in Karol's fieldnotes.
- for these, I want to delete the entry from flexiconCLEAN.csv, and transfer the other_sources
col to the flexicon_NewData.csv
- jesog is given phonetically as [je Éok], are we suggesting some type of word-final devoicing?
- assuming we're keeping the analysis that only nasal vowels occur following nasal consonants,
should we standardize the orthography to reflect that (i.e. by removing tildes from vowels
in this context?)
