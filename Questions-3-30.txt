péh - Weir gives this word as "a one", and SIL as "membro da classe de X".
	It doesn't appear as an independent lexeme in our fieldnotes, but it
	does appear in the words for 4 (ji ma poo oow péh) and 5 (ji me heet
	péh). Do we want to make an entry for this from our fieldnotes?
rʼoot - this is the root for the verb to speak. Our FLEx database, however,
	had entries for erʼoot, berʼoot, nerʼoo't and herʼoot. How many entries
	do we want to keep? Should we just keep the root rʼoot (with lexeme form
	erʼoot, as per convention?)
béak - Listed as PFX.ter.fruta. cf. (e)aak (ter.fruta). Do we want this as a 
	separate entry, or just delete it?
gãã - it was glossed as "ver," but so is "hegʼããs." I went ahead and made
	two entries, but just want to confirm - these are BOTH valid verbs
	attested in our fieldnotes?
tim - "tim" was defined in FLEx as "então", but so is "ti" - are these
	two synonyms?
näng - defined as "ser" in FLEx, but it isn't glossed in any examples I can
	find, and it's meaning isn't clear to me from context. 
tahawëënh - this entry was defined as "descer." I noticed there was a
	starred entry (from the SIL dictionary) that was awә:ɲ* and glossed
	as "descer.para.rio," so I changed awә:ɲ* to (a)wëënh, put the bibliography
	as Fieldnotes Epps/Obert 2019. I figured the prefixes ta-h- shouldn't be
	included in the entry. Do you think this was the right call?
wëët - this entry was defined as "andar." Should we make it a variant of
	(a)wät?
päh - defined as "ver." Do we want to make "hapäh" a variant of this?
gʼããs - ditto. Do we want to make "hegʼããs" a variant of this?
nä - defined as "vir." "na" (sem puntinhos) is also defined as "vir." Is one of
	these a typo?
